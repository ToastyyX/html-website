                        The Cocteau Twins were a Scottish alternative rock band formed in the early 1980s. 
                        Known for their dreamy and ethereal soundscapes, they became pioneers of the shoegaze and dream pop genres. 
                        The band's original lineup consisted of vocalist <strong>Elizabeth Fraser</strong>, guitarist <strong>Robin Guthrie</strong>, 
                        and bassist <strong>Will Heggie</strong>. Heggie was later replaced by <strong>Simon Raymonde</strong>, 
                        who became an integral part of the band's distinctive sound.

                        As of right now, my favorite album of Cocteau Twins is <strong>Blue Bell Knoll</strong>. The album provides a steady flow of dreamy, aetheral, and melancholic music. 
                        Starting from <strong>Carolyn's Fingers</strong> through <strong>Ella Megalast Burls Forever</strong>. One of my favorite tracks off Blue Bell Knoll is <strong>Cico Buff</strong>.
                        I'd recommend that song any day, it perfectly fits the vibe when taking a small drive late at night.
